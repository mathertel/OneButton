/*
 This is a sample sketch to show how to use the OneButtonLibrary
 to detect double-click events on a button. 
 The library internals are explained at
 http://www.mathertel.de/Arduino/OneButtonLibrary.aspx
  
 Setup a test circuit:
 * Connect a pushbutton to pin A1 (ButtonPin) and ground.
 * The pin 13 (StatusPin) is used for output attach a led and resistor to ground
   or see the built-in led on the standard arduino board.
   
 The Sketch shows how to setup the library and bind a special function to the doubleclick event.
 In the loop function the button.tick function has to be called as often as you like.

#include "OneButton.h"

// Setup a new OneButton on pin A1 wich connects the input pin to 5V when pressed and use the internal PULLUP.
OneButton button(A1, 0, true);


// setup code here, to run once:
void setup() {
  // enable the standard led on pin 13.
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);      // sets the digital pin as output
  
  // link the doubleclick function to be called on a doubleclick event.   
  button.attachDoubleClick(doubleclick);
} // setup
  

// main code here, to run repeatedly: 
void loop() {
  // keep watching the push button:
  button.tick();

  // You can implement other code in here or just wait a while 
  delay(10);
} // loop


// this function will be called when the button was pressed 2 times in a short timeframe.
void doubleclick() {
  static int m = LOW;
  // reverse the LED 
  m = !m;
  digitalWrite(13, m);
} // doubleclick

// End
